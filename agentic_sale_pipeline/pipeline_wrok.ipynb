      "Defining Clearbit's company values Clearbit customer login Blog > Defining Clearbit's company values Defining Clearbit's company values Matt Sornson | August 12, 2019 | 4 minute read In mid-2018, Clearbit was hitting an inflection point.\n",
      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company — deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of — it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",
      "being customer centric / empathy for customers\n",
      "learning\n",
      "excellence / hard work\n",
      "self-sufficiency\n",
      "fun\n",
      "honest communication\n",
      "team\n",
      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit) . Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it) . Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together) . Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There’s no such thing as “it’s not my job.”\n",
      "Truth (Say it) . Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful) . Don’t wait for permission. Figure it out — or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it) . Don’t take yourself too seriously — life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric \n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week \n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback \n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process — both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",

      "When building a successful business, it is essential to establish a clear understanding of the relationship between mission, vision, and core values. These three elements work together to guide the direction of the company and shape its culture. Let's delve into each of these components and explore how they interact with one another.\n",
      "Mission:\n",
      "The mission of a company is its purpose, the reason why it exists. It defines what the company does, who it serves, and how it adds value to its customers. A strong mission statement is concise, inspiring, and actionable. It serves as a roadmap for the organization, guiding decision-making and setting priorities. The mission statement should align with the company's goals and objectives, providing a clear direction for the future.\n",
      "Vision:\n",
      "The vision of a company is its long-term goal, the ultimate destination it aims to reach. It paints a picture of what the company aspires to become and sets the direction for growth and expansion. A compelling vision statement inspires employees, customers, and stakeholders, motivating them to work towards a common goal. The vision statement should be ambitious yet achievable, guiding the company's strategic decisions and shaping its future trajectory.\n",
      "Core Values:\n",
      "Core values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that guide the behavior and decisions of a company. They define the company's culture, shaping its identity and influencing its relationships with stakeholders. Core values serve as a moral compass, helping employees make ethical choices and fostering a sense of unity and purpose within the organization. The core values should be authentic, reflecting the company's beliefs and priorities, and should be integrated into every aspect of the business.\n",
      "Alignment: The mission, vision, and core values of a company should be aligned to ensure consistency and coherence in its operations.\n",
      "Inspiration: These elements should inspire and motivate employees, customers, and stakeholders, driving engagement and commitment.\n",
      "Guidance: The mission, vision, and core values should provide a clear direction for the company, guiding decision-making and setting priorities.\n",
      "Culture: These elements shape the company's culture, influencing its identity, behavior, and relationships with stakeholders.\n",
      "By understanding the relationship between mission, vision, and core values, companies can create a strong foundation for success, driving growth, innovation, and sustainability.\n",

      "Defining Clearbit's company values Clearbit customer login Blog > Defining Clearbit's company values Defining Clearbit's company values Matt Sornson | August 12, 2019 | 4 minute read In mid-2018, Clearbit was hitting an inflection point.\n",
      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company — deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of — it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",
      "being customer centric / empathy for customers\n",
      "learning\n",
      "excellence / hard work\n",
      "self-sufficiency\n",
      "fun\n",
      "honest communication\n",
      "team\n",
      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit) . Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it) . Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together) . Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There’s no such thing as “it’s not my job.”\n",
      "Truth (Say it) . Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful) . Don’t wait for permission. Figure it out — or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it) . Don’t take yourself too seriously — life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric \n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week \n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback \n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process — both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",

      "When building a successful business, it is essential to establish a clear understanding of the relationship between mission, vision, and core values. These three elements work together to guide the direction of the company and shape its culture. Let's delve into each of these components and explore how they interact with one another.\n",
      "Mission:\n",
      "The mission of a company is its purpose, the reason why it exists. It defines what the company does, who it serves, and how it adds value to its customers. A strong mission statement is concise, inspiring, and actionable. It serves as a roadmap for the organization, guiding decision-making and setting priorities. The mission statement should align with the company's goals and objectives, providing a clear direction for the future.\n",
      "Vision:\n",
      "The vision of a company is its long-term goal, the ultimate destination it aims to reach. It paints a picture of what the company aspires to become and sets the direction for growth and expansion. A compelling vision statement inspires employees, customers, and stakeholders, motivating them to work towards a common goal. The vision statement should be ambitious yet achievable, guiding the company's strategic decisions and shaping its future trajectory.\n",
      "Core Values:\n",
      "Core values are the fundamental beliefs and principles that guide the behavior and decisions of a company. They define the company's culture, shaping its identity and influencing its relationships with stakeholders. Core values serve as a moral compass, helping employees make ethical choices and fostering a sense of unity and purpose within the organization. The core values should be authentic, reflecting the company's beliefs and priorities, and should be integrated into every aspect of the business.\n",
      "Alignment: The mission, vision, and core values of a company should be aligned to ensure consistency and coherence in its operations.\n",
      "Inspiration: These elements should inspire and motivate employees, customers, and stakeholders, driving engagement and commitment.\n",
      "Guidance: The mission, vision, and core values should provide a clear direction for the company, guiding decision-making and setting priorities.\n",
      "Culture: These elements shape the company's culture, influencing its identity, behavior, and relationships with stakeholders.\n",
      "By understanding the relationship between mission, vision, and core values, companies can create a strong foundation for success, driving growth, innovation, and sustainability.\n",

      "Since our founding in 2014, we'd been running as a small, hyper-efficient, and profitable business. Just about everyone in the company would weigh in on new hires, and every new employee spent significant time with the entire leadership team to understand what our values were. This organic model started to show some cracks as we started to scale.\n",
      "At thirty-odd employees, Clearbit did already have a real set of values, even if not everyone could verbalize them. In line with how we were building the company — deliberately and with a close eye on creating a culture we all wanted to be a part of — it was time to get official. The challenge: to codify and articulate our internal operating principles.\n",
      "We've effectively tripled our team, while maintaining an incredibly high bar and preserving the culture we all cherish. Choosing and then using our values has been instrumental in that success.\n",
      "Surfacing values, from the bottom up\n",
      "We believe that values should be a reflection of the entire team, not just the CEO or leadership. So when we set out to formalize Clearbit's, we started by asking the team.\n",
      "We sent out a survey to every employee, asking them to submit up to three values that they thought best described our culture. Of equal importance, we asked that they nominate the person at Clearbit they thought best exemplified that value.\n",
      "We were expecting to see a wide array of suggestions and had anticipated that the responses would require some serious workshopping to produce a final set. Incredibly, from the over 70 value suggestions, ALL of them could be grouped into 7 themes.\n",
      "being customer centric / empathy for customers\n",
      "learning\n",
      "excellence / hard work\n",
      "self-sufficiency\n",
      "fun\n",
      "honest communication\n",
      "team\n",
      "We took this list and reworked them to sound as Clearbit-y as possible, which ended up being really easy as we had dozens of variations pre-written by everyone who had submitted ideas. We also combined two of the suggestions, as excellence and learning are inseparable in our minds.\n",
      "Clearbit's Values\n",
      "Care (Give a shit) . Empathize with customers. Take the time to understand their frustrations, needs, and desires.\n",
      "Craft (Master it) . Own your craft. Never stop learning and improving.\n",
      "Team (Work together) . Teamwork makes the dream work. Fill gaps. There’s no such thing as “it’s not my job.”\n",
      "Truth (Say it) . Be upfront and candid. Say it like it is. Hold yourself and others accountable.\n",
      "Initiative (Be resourceful) . Don’t wait for permission. Figure it out — or figure out who can.\n",
      "Fun (Have it) . Don’t take yourself too seriously — life is short.\n",
      "So how do we actually use our values?\n",
      "Even the most thoughtfully-produced company values don't matter unless they're put into practice and used tactically. And when they're not actively referenced and applied across the company, they become an out-of-mind list that merely exists as a slide or rarely-opened document.\n",
      "Hiring rubric \n",
      "We built value testing into our hiring rubric and created semi-standardized questions that let us investigate without having to ask questions like, \"are you a team player?\".\n",
      "Person of the week \n",
      "Every week at our all-hands meeting, we highlight one value and a person whose actions best exemplifies that value. This regular practice helps new people get acclimated and gives shape to a list of values they see in their onboarding docs. It also regularly reinforces the values across the company, providing repetition around what they are and a nice moment of recognition and appreciation for team members.\n",
      "Feedback \n",
      "We take feedback seriously here at Clearbit and have worked to weave our values into that process — both by celebrating when someone really is leaning into a value and recognizing the learning moments when we fail to (which we all do sometimes).\n",
      "Values are alive!\n",
      "Our list of values is a living document that will evolve and change as we do. A company culture inevitably changes, and our values need to grow with us. If the values don't align or resonate with the individual values of our team, it's time to change.\n",
      "results of an internal survey measuring alignment between personal and company values\n",
      "Having integrity with our values is what builds trust in our relationships, and because we believe trust is the most basic building block of any organization, we commit to checking back on an annual basis to make sure we have values that truly represent our culture.\n",
      "It's easy to discount corporate values as just lip service and nice words to stick on the wall. However, when carefully created and implemented, values provide a constitution for your company culture, a true rubric that helps you hire, fire, promote, retain, and celebrate your team.\n",

      "Lending interest rates in the Global South average near 15%, compared to just 4% in the Global North. One major reason is a lack of financial transparency in challenging markets. Without reliable data, lenders can’t accurately assess risks, so they charge higher premiums to protect themselves.\n",
      "​\n",
      "While many other factors contribute to higher rates, this lack of transparency raises costs while amplifying the fear of losses, making borrowing even more expensive. The good news is that every step toward better financial tracking has a powerful ripple effect. Small improvements in data quality can significantly lower lending costs, opening up affordable credit for entrepreneurs and creating real change in the system.\n",

      "Why Your Current Approach Isn’t Unlocking Capital You’ve invested in training, mentoring, and community building. But donors and Financial Service Providers want hard metrics before they increase project funding or lend money to a business. Generic impact reports explaining courses completed and anecdotal success stories just don’t cut it anymore. We see this create three main problems for support organizations looking to help small businesses improve around the world: 1 Visibility Gap You can’t show whether your training actually improves business outcomes or creditworthiness.

      "2 Grant Dependency Without financial rigor, short-term grants are often the only source of capital for the businesses supported. More Info\n",
